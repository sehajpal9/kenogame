simple keno game in java


I ran this game in the terminal using maven. In order to run this you have to have maven installed on your computer.
First you will open your terminal and go to the directory your project is located in. Once you are there run 
mvn clean followed by mvn compile. After you run each of these, it should say build success. After that you will 
run mvn exec:java and the application will open. 

Once its open you can read the rules and odds of the game from the dropdown menu. After reading about the game
you can press the play button and start the game. You will start by picking the number of spots followed by the number of drawings. You then have 2 options: randomly generate or start. Randomly generate will automatically pick the users
spots and start will alow you to manually pick your spots from the board. 

After the spots are chosen it will show you how many matches and earnings you have.
